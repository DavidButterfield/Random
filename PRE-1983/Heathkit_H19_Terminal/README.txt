This is a Heathkit H19 ASCII terminal I built from a kit.  I don't remember exactly when I built
it, probably 1980 plus or minus a year.  I also don't remember when I boxed it up, but it was no
later than 1993.  The photographs were taken in 2022 when I opened the box.

The box was fairly clean inside, despite having been in a garage since 1999 and not having been
sealed around the edges.  There is just a little dust inside the terminal itself, which I'll
blow out before putting the cover back on and plugging it in.

Dusted it off and switched it on.  Seems to work in OFFLINE mode.

Connected the H19 to the Bucky Box.  H19 seems to be working fine.
