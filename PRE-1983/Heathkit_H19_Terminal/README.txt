This is a Heathkit H19 ASCII terminal I built from a kit.  I don't remember exactly when I built
it, probably 1980 plus or minus a year.  I also don't remember when I boxed it up, but it was no
later than 1993.  The photographs were taken in 2022 when I opened the box.

The box was fairly clean inside, despite having been in a garage since 1999 and not having been
sealed around the edges.  There is just a little dust inside the terminal itself, which I'll
blow out before putting the cover back on and plugging it in.
