Comment from a tech writer (Judy) admonishing developers for being too nerdy on
a wide-audience Sun internal newsgroup, where we had been discussing Intel 8259
spurious interrupt behavior:

    Oh Developers wise, I am curious
    As you type back and forth fast and furious
	You have carefully figured
	The interrupts edge-triggered
    Now can we dispense with the interrupts spurious?

My reply a few minutes later:

    Many old hackers are prone
    To rattle and prattle and drone
	About subjects arcane
	We're a journeyman's bane
    But it's useless to whimper and moan

    The subject's a real confuser
    It wasn't put there to amuse 'er
	But maybe it ought to
	It isn't her lot to
    Explain it at all to the user
