Dark Side of the SAN
By DAB, with apologies to Mr. Floyd*

Ticking away the snapshots that make up a dull day
Fritter and waste the space in an offhand way
Installing a FOM [1] on some space that you glom from its home SAN [2]
Waiting for someday a quorum that's short by a man
...

And then one day you find alarms going off behind you
No one told you where to run, this day will be no fun

You get a call from The Man, "Hey buddy speed up that SAN", but it's syncing
Racing around the subnet for most of a day
The SAN is the same in some 'eventual' way but you're older
Wishing for death and muttering under your breath.

* There is no Mr. Floyd really... matter of fact it's all Floyd.

[1] Fail-Over Manager arbitrates quorum loss for an even number of cluster nodes
[2] A useful exercise is to understand why that is not a good idea
